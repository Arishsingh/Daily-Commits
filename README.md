# 🗓️ Daily Commit Log – Arish Singh

Welcome to my daily commitment tracker. I use this repo to push something every single day – no matter how big or small – just to keep learning, building, and growing!

## 📚 What I’m learning:
- Java & MERN stack development
- Blockchain & AI concepts
- DevRel strategies
- Open source collaboration

---

## 🔥 Streak Rule:
Make at least **1 commit a day** – push code, notes, bug fixes, or updates.

## 📁 Log:
Each day is stored as a markdown file under `2025/Month/Day.md`.

Let’s stay consistent 💪 and build every day 🚀
